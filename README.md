# CalciCare: Osteoporosis Risk Assessment 🦴

**CalciCare** is a machine learning project aimed at predicting the risk of osteoporosis in patients based on their medical records. Osteoporosis weakens bones, making them fragile and prone to fractures, especially in older individuals. By analyzing various patient data such as age, hormonal changes, lifestyle habits, and nutrition, **CalciCare** provides early identification of high-risk individuals, enabling preventive care and management.

## 📊 Data Overview

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Age**, **Gender**
- **Hormonal Changes** (e.g., postmenopause)
- **Family History** of osteoporosis
- **Nutritional Factors** (Calcium, Vitamin D levels)
- **Physical Activity**, **Smoking**, **Alcohol Consumption**
- **Medical Conditions** (e.g., hyperthyroidism)
- **Medication** (e.g., corticosteroids)
- **Body Weight**
- **Prior Fractures**

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Age**: Older patients, particularly over 40, have a significantly higher risk.
2. **Hormonal Changes**: Individuals who have experienced hormonal changes, like menopause, show increased susceptibility to osteoporosis.
3. **Nutritional Deficiency**: Low calcium and vitamin D levels are strongly associated with higher osteoporosis risk.
4. **Physical Activity**: Active lifestyles help in lowering the risk of bone density loss.
5. **Body Weight**: Lower body weight correlates with higher fragility and risk.
6. **Medical Conditions & Medications**: Conditions like hyperthyroidism and long-term corticosteroid use contribute to higher risk.

## 🚀 Conclusion

**CalciCare** leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of osteoporosis, allowing for early interventions and personalized healthcare strategies. This tool can assist healthcare professionals in identifying and managing high-risk patients, contributing to better bone health outcomes.
